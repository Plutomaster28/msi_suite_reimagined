## üêõ "Features" Not Bugs

- **Slow loading times**: Intentional! Corporate software is never fast
- **Multiple confirmations**: Working as designed! Bureaucracy demands it
- **Failed print jobs**: Printer is always offline in corporate hell
- **Fake admin approvals**: Any password works - it's all theater
- **Excessive logging**: Big Brother is watching... everything
- **Auto-save popups**: Designed to interrupt your workflow
- **Nested menus**: Can't find anything? Perfect!

## üìù Where Are the Logs?

The application creates audit logs here:
```
%AppData%\MeiseiEnterprise\Logs\audit_[timestamp].log
```

Or in PowerShell:
```powershell
# Open the log directory
explorer $env:APPDATA\MeiseiEnterprise\Logs
```

## üéÉ Pro Tips for Maximum Horror

1. **Demo to friends**: Their reactions are priceless
2. **Time the confirmations**: See how long it takes to do simple tasks
3. **Read the error messages**: They're hilariously corporate
4. **Check the Analytics Dashboard**: Bathroom break tracking is *chef's kiss*
5. **Try everything**: Each module has unique horrors

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**"It won't start"**
- Make sure you have .NET 8.0 SDK installed
- Check you're on Windows (this nightmare requires Windows)

**"It's running but nothing happens"**
- Be patient! There are intentional delays everywhere
- Each loading screen takes 10-15 seconds

**"The confirmations are too much"**
- That's the point! Welcome to corporate software circa 2000

**"I can't close it"**
- Yes you can! Just confirm 4 times that you really want to exit
- Or use Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) like a real corporate employee

## üéä You're Ready!

Now go forth and experience the horror of enterprise software done wrong (or done exactly like it was in 2000).

Remember: This is satire. Please don't actually build software like this!

Happy Halloween! üéÉüëª
